### Project Euler Challenge

For a bit of fun, and to improve on my algorithmic thinking, I'm going to be working my way through the challenges on project euler dot com.

##### ToDo

Structure each problem into its own directory and implement some unit tests.

Refactor (hopefully get rid of a few for loops) the code and look for optimal solutions.
